# Data Center management

## main components of the datacenter
* CARC
* PDU
* UPS System
* Electrical Primary SwitchGear
* Pump Rooms
* Fuel Oil Storage Tanks
* Colocation Suites
* Heat Rejection Devices
* Emergancy Diesel Generators

## Traditional datacenter Architecture
speed difference between processor and ram is matched by the use
of FSB
* Front side Bus : Bus between Processor and RAM
* Back side Bus : Bus between L1 and L2 cache

### Size of the rack is defined by the units
* 1U = 1.5"
* 2U = 3"

### Operating cost of the data center
* servers : 57%
* Networking Equiments : 8%
* Power Distribution : 18%
* Power : 13%

### Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)

power used by the DC Facility / power transmitted to Facility

### PUE Generations 
* Generation 1
* Generation 2
* Generation 3
* Generation 4
* Generation 5


### Data Center challanges
* Cooling data centers
    * conventional cooling
    * Cold Aisle Containment
    * Hot Aisle Containment
    * Thermal modelling  
* Energy Proportional Computing 
* Servers are idle most of the time
* Efficient Monitoring
* Improving resource utilization
* Managing scale and growth
* Size and growth of DC
* networking at scale 


### Types of Data Centers(DC)
* Colocation Data Centers
* Enterprice Data Centers
* Managed services Data Centers
* Cloud Data Centers
* Edge Data Centers
* Micro Data Centers

### Hybrid Data Center Architecture
* this type of data center purely works on the virual machines

### Data center Management Challenges
* Infrastructure Complexcity
* SLA Requirements
* Change Management
* Cost Management   
  
<br>

### Data center Security standards
* Layered Security Measures
* Access List
* Video Surveillance
* Secure access points
* 24x7x365 Security
